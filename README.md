This is a Flutter project, using the Dart language.

The project is buillt following the Clean Architecture :

Using this architecture, you can implement new features quite easily, even if it takes some time to understand each part.

The main Dart library used is [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get), we use it for State managment, local storage, navigation, themes, snackbar, dialogs and internationalization.
